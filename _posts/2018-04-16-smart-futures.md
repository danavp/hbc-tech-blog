With so many great tech initiatives out there and limited time to contribute, it can be a tough choice for a volunteer to pick one (or a few) initiatives to get involved with.

Different initiatives target different issues (e.g. diversity, education) and as a volunteer your tasks will vary (e.g. teaching children, presenting to adults, organising events).

# How to pick an initiative 

There are 4 questions I would ask myself as a volunteer looking to get involved; I expect the answers to be very subjective, but I included my answers for reference:
  1. What issues matter the most to me ?
        
        Students choosing CS (Computer Science) in college do not have a concrete idea of what CS is.
         
        I found that many class-mates were deceived as they had a false and stereotypical expectation of what CS would be. On the other side, many highschool class-mates never even considered CS either (for the same reason) and might have missed a passion!
        
        I want to educate students about CS to break stereotypes and allow them to make an informed choice.
        
  
  2. How can I address those issues ?
        
        I can use my CS knowledge and experience working in Tech to inform students
  
  3. Do I have other expectations about my volunteering experience ?
  
        I like teaching, explaining to children and presenting in general
        
  4. Is there an existing initiative aligning with my goal ?
        
        Yes at least 2 that I know of: [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com/) and [Smart Futures](http://www.smartfutures.ie/)
        
Depending on where you live and where you work, you will have more or less options; but keep in mind that some initiatives like [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com/) will help you set up local Computing classes and have a lot of resources that can help you.

You could also get inspired on existing initiatives like [Smart Futures](http://www.smartfutures.ie/) which is Ireland-based to create a similar program in your country of residence.



# What is Smart Futures

[Smart Futures](http://www.smartfutures.ie/)'s objective is getting children interested in [S.T.E.M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) subjects in secondary school and at third level.
It is coordinated by the [Science Foundation Ireland](http://www.sfi.ie/).

There are two types of events:
  - you contacting directly schools or highschools to give talks / presentations / workshops to classes, the format is free
  - [Smart Futures](http://www.smartfutures.ie/) asking you to send some volunteers to participate at events they are organising (occasional)

You have no obligations of frequency, you only have to contact [Smart Futures](http://www.smartfutures.ie/) when you give a presentation to a school to help them map what schools are getting visited.

# Why it's awesome

What is important about the initiative is that **you** are going to the schools.

The children you are talking to haven't been signed up to a coding class, they can come from all backgrounds and might have no relatives working in the industry.

It is an opportunity for them to picture concretely what Tech is, get excited about projects they could work on and get some answers about the inner workings of applications they use every day (at a high level)!

To quote the website:

>Many students have no access to anyone working in science and technology, or may not know anyone that went to college.

# Our experience

[Jake Whelan](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/jakewhelan) and I have given 2 presentations to classes of ~50 children aged 10-11.

We figured that children of that age want to have examples as concrete as possible, and decided not to talk about our company too much as eCommerce might be abstract for children of that age (probably non-shoppers!).

Our presentation kept the introductions short, we showed a very simple JavaScript-based game that we created (along with the code) and made sure to keep the presentation as interactive as possible.

The little game was a very simplified version of [Cookie clicker](orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/), a web-page showed a cookie and a number that incremented every time you clicked on the cookie. We spent as much time as needed an let the children ask all the questions they had in order to understand how the code worked.

It allowed us to introduce them to variables, if statements and even events (a click). So, then, we let them ask us about applications they use every day and we can use those fundamental building blocks to be concrete in our explanations.

The presentation format is not enforced by [Smart Futures](http://www.smartfutures.ie/), and you should adapt your presentation to the audience (age) but also to what you're confortable presenting!

## Our tips

Show the simplest example of code and encourage the children to ask questions about it; it is probably the first time they are exposed to it so, if no question is asked, ask them questions about the code! (e.g what happens if I change this, how does the program know what to do when using this function)

Let them ask questions about the applications they use every day.

Send resources to the teachers after the presentation, so if children were interested during the presentation there is some follow up. (My favorites are [Code.org](https://code.org/) and [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/))

# How do I get involved

You can get involved individually or as a company by contacting [smartfutures@sfi.ie](smartfutures@sfi.ie), you will be invited to a presentation about the initiative and be registered as a volunteer.

# Help us find schools

If you are a parent, or part of a school council, you can help us by reaching out to teachers/principals who would be interested in having us present to their students (in the Dublin area).
